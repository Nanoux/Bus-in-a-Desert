# Bus-in-a-Desert
Its a bus in a very big desert

I made this game at the request of a friend to make a modern version of Desert Bus, I made this, than the official Desert Bus remaster came out and kind of killed my motivation:P

For this project, I made a custom Bus model, infinite terrain generation system,custom shaders, car control system, graphics settings, and an AI.

WASD to drive if AI isnt on, arrow keys to look around, and F to switch camera modes.

You can turn off the god awful pixelation effect in settings if its on by default for you :P

Heres a gif, I guess Github can't handle those: https://i.imgur.com/Hf9txhU.gifv
